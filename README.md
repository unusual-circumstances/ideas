# ideas
Each idea is the germ that spawns new beginnings.

## basic concept

The basic concept of this repo is that an idea is a complete thought, and this can be made into a dynamic agent that can interact with a blockchain network.

## less stupid basic concept

Ideas are just that. Ideas. Fun things to develop further. Filed under the MIT license, ideas are there to be shared, improved, or encouraged not to continue.
