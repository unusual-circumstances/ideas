# 001

The first idea in this collection of 999 ideas.

if you will, a meta idea.

## the idea

the idea is that you can take ideas and turn them into projects with more success throug the nft model. The reason being, is that you don't need to obtain the assitance of sophsiticated yet expensive services. Rather, you can use less expensive and less restrictive services, many of which are free and open source. There are expenses involved, but they are minimal compared to traditional methos because a lot of the friction has been engineered away.

## the execution

999 complete ideas, including an idea.md file with the entirety of the idea, some basic code to assist with implementation of the idea, and a simple implementation of said ideas. Most will be art projects, but some might transcend even my ability to predict.

## the hope

that this helps me keep a clean record of my ideas over time, and expand on the good ones, while developing my skills and executing code
